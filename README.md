# Mac Dev Machine Setup

This repo will automatically setup a new mac so I don't have to go through the faff of installing and configuring everything each time I need to setup a new computer.

To run, it should just be a case of running `./install.sh`

## To setup personal .ssh key:

Run `./install-personal-ssh-key.sh`.
