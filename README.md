# Mac Dev Machine Setup

This repo will automatically setup a new mac so I don't have to go through the faff of installing and configuring everything each time I need to setup a new computer.

To run, it should just be a case of running `./install.sh`

## Assumptions

1. I use 1Password as my SSH Agent and requires to be installed and configured to act as the SSH Agent.
2. I have a personal and work laptop with two different GitHub Users. It is assumed you have a personal and work ssh key stored within 1Password.
3. Assumes you are logged into the Mac AppStore.
